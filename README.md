High-level and Convenient BitTorrent Client based on aria2 JSON-RPC.

+ [x] Download aria2 for your platform
+ [ ] Simple BitTorrent downloading API
+ [ ] Event bus for progress, state change, and so on

## Usage

### Browser / Node.js

```bash
npm i naria2
```

Using WebSocket:

```ts
import { createClient } from 'naria2'

const client = await createClient(
  new WebSocket('ws://localhost:6800/jsonrpc')
)
```

Using HTTP:

```ts
import { createClient } from 'naria2'
import { createHTTP } from 'naria2/transport'

const client = await createClient(
  createHTTP('http://localhost:6800/jsonrpc')
)
```

### Node.js standalone

If you want to use naria2 in the Node.js standalone, you can install `@naria2/node`. It has included a [prebuilt aria2 binary](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix/tree/master/extra) according to your architecture, so that there is no need to install a [aria2](https://github.com/aria2/aria2) on your own.

```bash
npm i naria2 @naria2/node
```

You can use the `createSubprocess` API to spawn an aria2 child process, and connect to it in WebScoket under the hood.

```ts
import { createClient } from 'naria2'
import { createSubprocess } from '@naria2/node'

const client = await createClient(
  createSubprocess()
)
```

> **Warning**
>
> You should **close the client on your own**, otherwise the aria2 process **may not be killed** even if your program finished or crashed.
>

## Cross-platform aria2c
